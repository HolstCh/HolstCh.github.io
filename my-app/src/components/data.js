            "This research project involves designing and implementing a software/hardware integration to provide underwater drone control for Unmanned Vehicles Robotarium research lab. Our team successfully integrated various electronic components and developed software to control the underwater drone. We had developed a GUI using Python that is capable of communicating with a Raspberry Pi and PX4 flight controller to send commands and read movement data. The project consists of a GUI, a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B, Pixhawk 4 autopilot, a drone prototype, and a list of other various electronic components. The projectâ€™s main objective is deploying and navigating the drone prototype within confined underwater spaces.",
