            "This research project involves designing and implementing a software/hardware integration to provide control for a drone prototype. Our team successfully integrated various electronic components and developed software to control the underwater drone. We had developed a GUI using Python that is capable of communicating with a Raspberry Pi and PX4 flight controller to send commands and read movement data. The project consists of a GUI, a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B, Pixhawk 4 autopilot, a drone prototype, and other various electronics.",

Every time a document is created, a share code is generated and the user is able to share their document with another user.",
